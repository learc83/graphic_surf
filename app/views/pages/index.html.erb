	Hello, I'm Michael Krontz; this is my online portfolio. Iâ€™m a visual designer who
	lives in the Atlanta area, not the beach...unfortunately. Below you will find
	several pieces of my latest work. I have extensive experience in print, identity, and
	interactive. You can get in touch with me by using the contact form at the bottom of the
	page. I look forward to hearing from you. Mahalo!
